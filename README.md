The project examined the academic and socioeconomic backgrounds of admits to UW-Madison' Business School. In particular, what kind of student is the average UW-Madison
business student? Did they perform well on the AP classes they took in highschool? Do they have competitive ACT and/or SAT scores? Where (in the US or abroad) are they admitted from? Are they from an affluent or underrepresented community?
